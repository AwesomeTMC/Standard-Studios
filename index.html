		           Hey there! Welcome to Standard studios! We are a team of developers for VR, currently we are working on a couple of games, implementations and some research projects! Some of the things we will be working on will be available to the Oculus Rift, the Quest and the Go, if you are a creative developer or story writer, join our team! Or our discord. We hope to experiment with the Questâ€™s new hand tracking and implement it into a couple of games as well! Creative developers are welcome!
