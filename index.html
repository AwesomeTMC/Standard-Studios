		           Hey there! Welcome to Standard studios!
We are a VR and game development studio, but unlike other conventional studios, we don’t have a brick-and-Mortar location!
We are based entirely online! We are currently starting up, and we are accepting applications!
During this first little bit, it will not pay, it’s mainly for the good of VR and the community, come join us! 





We are a team of developers for VR, currently we are working on a couple of games, implementations and some research projects!
Some of the things we will be working on will be available to the Oculus Rift, the Quest and the Go,
if you are a creative developer or story writer, join our team! Or our discord. We hope to experiment with the Quest’s new hand tracking and implement it into a couple of games as well! 
Creative developers are welcome!
